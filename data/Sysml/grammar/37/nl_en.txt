When the vehicle is in the "Off" state, upon receiving the "Vehicle Start Signal", the system enters the "Start" state; upon receiving the "Vehicle Movement Signal", it enters the "On" state. When the vehicle is in the "On" state, the system first performs a self-check operation, then provides power, and applies the parking brake upon exit. Finally, when the "Vehicle Shutdown Signal" is received, the system returns to the "Off" state.
