The lifecycle of a vehicle begins with assembly, and a snapshot is taken at the time of delivery, recording the delivery date. After that, the vehicle enters the ownership stage, where each owner's record is saved as a time slice, and the relationship between each owner and the vehicle is arranged in sequence. During the ownership stage of the vehicle, the vehicle may undergo multiple drives, each involving a driver, and the driver's information is saved as a time slice. When the vehicle is scrapped, the system records a "scrapped" snapshot, marking the end of the vehicle's lifecycle.
