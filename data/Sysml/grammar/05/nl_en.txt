The colors of the traffic signal lights include three types: green, yellow, and red.
The traffic signal light component contains an attribute to represent the current color, and the value of this attribute must be limited to one of these three colors.
In addition, it should also include a traffic signal light component that allows passage, which is a subtype of the traffic signal light component, and redefines its color attribute as green.
