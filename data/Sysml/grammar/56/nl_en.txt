Each object has a simple mass (simpleMass) and a total mass (totalMass). For simple objects, their total mass equals their simple mass. For composite objects, they are composed of multiple subcomponents, each of which also has its own mass attribute. The total mass of a composite object is the sum of its simple mass and the total mass of all its subcomponents. In this way, the system can calculate the total mass of the entire object by summarizing the mass of each component.
