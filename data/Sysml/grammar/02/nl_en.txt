Vehicles include three types: human-driven vehicles, power-driven vehicles, and hybrid vehicles. 
Human-driven vehicles must designate a driver; 
Power-driven vehicles must be equipped with an engine to provide power; 
While hybrid vehicles need to support both the driver and the engine simultaneously.
