The operation of braking is first initiated by an activation action to start the braking process. After initiation, the system performs the operations of monitoring brake pedal pressure and traction force in parallel, and executes braking actions based on the feedback of brake pressure and modulation frequency. Specifically, the system monitors the pressure of the brake pedal and transfers it to the braking action, while monitoring the traction force and transferring the modulation frequency to the braking action. After all these operations are completed, the system ends this process after all tasks are executed.
