The fuel management system includes a fuel tank and an engine. 
The fuel tank is connected to the input port of the engine through an output port, responsible for supplying fuel to the engine, or returning the fuel. 
Each port monitors the temperature attribute, used to indicate the temperature of the fuel. 
In addition, the flow direction of fuel supply and return is distinguished, the output port is responsible for supplying fuel to the system, while the input port accepts and returns fuel. 
The function of the entire system is to ensure the effective management of fuel between supply and return, and maintain temperature control to ensure the normal operation of the system.
