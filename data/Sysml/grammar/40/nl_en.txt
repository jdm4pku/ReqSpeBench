The system monitors the vehicle's temperature in real time through sensors, and switches states based on the set maximum temperature and maintenance time. When the vehicle's temperature exceeds the set maximum temperature, the system sends an over-temperature signal to the controller and enters the "degraded" state. In the degraded state, the system continues to monitor the temperature, and once the temperature returns to normal, it returns to the "normal" state. If the vehicle reaches the maintenance time, the system triggers maintenance operations and updates the maintenance time, then returns to the "normal" state.
