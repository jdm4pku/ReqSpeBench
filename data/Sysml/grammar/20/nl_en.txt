The photography system involves three items: scenes, images, and photos. 
The main operations of the system include three actions: focusing, shooting, and photographing. 
The focusing operation obtains information from the scene and generates an image; 
The shooting operation uses this image to generate a photo. 
The photographing operation directly generates a photo from the scene, it first obtains information from the scene and generates an image through the focusing operation, then the image is passed to the shooting operation to generate a photo. 
In this process, the system ensures that the focusing operation and the shooting operation are executed in order, with the focusing operation being performed first, followed by the shooting operation. To ensure the smoothness of the process, the image output in the photographing operation is bound with the image input of the shooting operation, and finally, the photo output of the shooting operation is bound with the photo output of the photographing operation, thus achieving a complete image capture and output process.
