Each car part has a unique serial number, and the car body is composed of multiple parts, including the engine and transmission, etc. The total weight of the car is derived by summing up the weights of all parts, where the weight of the car itself is 1000 kilograms, the weight of the engine is 100 kilograms, and the weight of the transmission is 50 kilograms. Finally, the calculated total weight of the car is 1150 kilograms, ensuring that the weight information of all parts is accurately summarized and provides complete weight data.
