The server tracks the current time through the local clock and transitions states based on different events. When the "Start" signal is received, the server enters the "Waiting" state, ready to accept requests. Once a request is received, the server enters the "Response" state, processes the request, and returns to the "Waiting" state after 5 minutes. If the current time reaches 11:59:00 of the day, the server will automatically enter the "Shutdown" state.
