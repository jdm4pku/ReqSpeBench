Each object contains a simple mass (simpleMass) and a total mass (totalMass), where the total mass defaults to the simple mass. For composite objects, they are composed of multiple subcomponents, and the total mass of the composite object is the sum of its simple mass and the total mass of all subcomponents. For filtered objects, the system will filter the subcomponents according to the set minimum mass value (minMass), only calculating the mass of subcomponents that are greater than or equal to the minimum mass value, ultimately obtaining a filtered total mass.
