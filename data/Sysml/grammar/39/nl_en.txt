The system starts from the "off" state, and after receiving the "vehicle start signal", it enters the "start" state; after receiving the "vehicle movement signal", it enters the "on" state; in the "on" state, if it receives the "vehicle flameout signal", it re-enters the "off" state. In addition, the system also manages the health status of the vehicle, this part of the status is not specifically listed, but it runs in parallel with the operating status, ensuring that the vehicle can maintain normal operation and monitor health conditions under different states.
