The system simulates the vehicle's motion trajectory through a series of dynamic calculations. 
Firstly, the system calculates the position and speed of the vehicle at each time step based on the given power, mass, initial position, and initial speed parameters. 
This process is completed through cyclic iteration, with each iteration calculating a new position and speed based on the current power value and updating the calculation results to the next iteration. 
Finally, the system saves all the calculated positions to form a complete motion trajectory.
