The server tracks time through the local clock and switches states based on different events. When the "Start" signal is received, the server enters the "Waiting" state, waiting for the arrival of requests. Once a request is received, the server enters the "Response" state and returns to the "Waiting" state after 5 minutes. At a specific point in time (for example, at 11:59:00 of the day), the server will automatically enter the "Shutdown" state.
